This Repository contains all infomation and code used for the Group work assignment for MS999 - Health Economics and Evaluation. 

The only vital files to review are the R file: "All Code - Up2Date.R" and the csv files: "Ghana.csv" and "CHWs.csv" 
The other CSV files are included as these were used to create the "Ghana.csv" file, and should only be used if interested in learning how the complete dataset was created
Code for how this was done is located at the bottom of the R file.
